Subject: Completed Tasks for Codsoft Project

Hi SIR/MADAM,

I wanted to update you on the tasks I've completed for the Codsoft project:

Task 1: Guessing Number – Developed a program where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specific range. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and tracks the number of attempts remaining.

Task 2: Simple Calculator – Created a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The calculator handles user input, performs the operation, and displays the result in a user-friendly format.

Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game – Built a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can take turns to place their markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner and handles invalid moves or board states.

Task 4: To-Do List – Developed a to-do list application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The app provides functionality to mark tasks as completed and ensures that the tasks are displayed in an organized, easy-to-use interface.
